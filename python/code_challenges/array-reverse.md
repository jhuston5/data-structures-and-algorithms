# Reverse an Array Code Challenge 01
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Utilizing a variable to decrement the length of the given array was the most efficient method we found to rapidly iterate and push to a new array.

## Collaboration

Worked with Chris Rarig to develop algorithm and work through whiteboarding.
