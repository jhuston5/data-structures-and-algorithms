# Code Challenge 16 - Max Value

This app creates a function that finds the maximum value in an unordered binary tree.

### Functions:

- max_val(): finds a maximum value within an unordered binary tree.

### Tests:

- Test if the a tree with only a root value will be returned as max
- Test for a max left leaf
- Test for a max right leaf
- Test for a max right-middle leaf
- Test for a max left-middle leaf

## Reflections and Comments

My whiteboard was extremely helpful for this lab. I was able to create a visualization that made sense to me, which made writing a clear algorithm and code far simpler for me. One challenge was finding a way to store the max variable in a recursive function, and the way I solved was to make the maxixum a nonlocal variable. Hopefully that is not a big programming worst practice!
# Code Challenge 15 - Trees

This app creates a Binary Tree class, as well as a Binary Search tree.

### Functions:

- in_order: left > root > right
- pre_order: root > left > right
- post_order: left > right > root
- add: adds value to binary tree
- contains: checks if value is in the tree, returns boolean

### Tests:

- empty root
- single root
- in_order
- pre_order
- post_order
- add
- contains

## Reflections and Comments

Tough lab here - trying to continue visualizing recursive functions and build them out appropriately. Overall, lots of learning in this lab.
