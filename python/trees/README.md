# Code Challenge 15 - Trees

This app creates a Binary Tree class, as well as a Binary Search tree.

### Functions:

- in_order: left > root > right
- pre_order: root > left > right
- post_order: left > right > root
- add: adds value to binary tree
- contains: checks if value is in the tree, returns boolean

### Tests:

- Passing a correct string returns True
- Passing an incorrect string returns False
- Passing a string with characters other than brackets ignores those characters

## Reflections and Comments

Tough lab here - trying to continue visualizing recursive functions and build them out appropriately. Overall, lots of learning in this lab.


# Pass largest number in recursive call
# then return largest value
# Start from one of the traversal orders
# Test root being the largest
# Test leaf on the left, right, middle left, middle right.
