## Reflections and Comments

I worked with Bionca Bond on the stack class functions.

Modularized the Node, Stack, and Queue classes, and separated Stack and Queue tests into their own files. Needs the python -m stack_queue.stack or stack_queue.queue command to run. I also learned how to use a pytest fixture to simplify some of my test creation.
