# Data Structures and Algorithms

See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.

## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `javascript` folder, at the top level, is a sub-folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

If you have not already done so, run `npm install` from within this folder to setup your system to be able to run tests using `Jest`

To run your tests

- Change to the `javascript` folder
- run `npm test` to run all of the tests
- run `npm test ##` to only run tests for challenge ## (i.e. 01)

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

This lab went fine, it took me approximately 3.5 hours to complete. It was a bit tough ensuring that the head and nodes were all pointing to each other correctly. I worked with Chris Rarig, Ian Cargill, and Bionca Bond to ensure that all the functions were working correctly.

This lab went fine, it took me approximately 3.5 hours to complete. Ensuring all of my head, next, and values were set correctly for all of the methods was definitely the hardest part. I worked with Cooper Boyce on the whiteboard portion.

Completed all tests, including an optional test to append a value to an empty array. Had some help from Bionca to get my final test #4 passing! Had to handle an exception for the head value being the old value.

### [Code Challenge 07 - Linked List Extension Select Kth Number](/python/README.md)
